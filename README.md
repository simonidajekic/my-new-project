# Utok (or YouTalk)
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
My project is supposed to help people who are in need of therapy, but aren't able to go there (for whatever reason). It would be a chatbot that has all information on mental disorders and psychosis, but also information on the patient (their medical history). People could talk about their problems, which would help many that feel left out or unheard. The chat bot would have two functions: 1. to chat with the "patient" and 2. to recognize potential mental disorders

## Background
As a teenager myself, I am aware of the fact how frequent mental ilnesses and disorders are in my age group, but also in general. Teenagers often feel neglected, especially if they are bullied at school and feel like they have no one to talk to. I believe a chatbot could help them, just for talking or as a psychologist, it would make things better at the time where suicide rates are rising. People could also ask questions regarding their problems in hopes of getting diagnosed and having their problems treated. For example, a person reads a text about OCD and realizes that they potentially have some symptoms. They talk to the chatbot, which asks them some important and crucial things on which the disorder is based. Based on the number of symptoms and their frequency, the chatbot would give a percentage of likeliness of having that disorder.
This topic is very important because not everyone has money to go to therapy or physically isn't able to, or perhaps the person is underage and their parent(s) are against them going. Unfortunately, there are some problems that could potentially occur.
For example:
* the chatbot would need to be used many times before launching it, for it to know how to "talk" with people. Even then it could potentially "say something wrong" 
* the chatbot could give a wrong diagnosis
These problems cannot be solved easily, there should be a person who would notice them and solve them, but then the point of AI is completely lost. 

## How is it used?
Anyone can be a user, but they would need to agree to giving their medical record and state if they or someone in their family has a history of mental problems and state which. These things are very private and should not be sold as information to other companies. 
During the pandemic, especially the lockdown, many problems in mental health occured, which, just as in our physical, shouldn't be ignored. The chatbot could help, especially to people who suffer from hypochondria, OCD and nosophobia (phobia of diseases).
If the chatbot recognises that it cannot help the person because of how hard their condition is and estimates that they need a help from psychiatrist it alerts them and their chosen psychiatrist.
In situations where the chatbot estimates that the person is suicidal it offers to the person to call a suicide prevention hotline.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges
One of the main problems is: what happens if the person harms themself in any way while using the chatbot? Who would be responsible for it? 
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
